;This LTX combines all of the look uptables used by Magazines Redux into one place. 
;Wild card includes are used for all three tables to facilitate adding information requred for compatablity with weapon mods.


;Weapons:	Think of this as a supplement to a weapons section to add information needed for magazines.
;			Keeping it in a lookup table ensures maximum compatablity.



;Outfit loadouts:	Suplemental information for outfits or classes of outfits describing how many magazines of each size the outfit allows you to carry.




;Base types can be thought of as a magazine compatablity standard, similar to STANAG or the comanality of magazines used by AKs.
;The weapon look up tables and the magazine item sections have base_type entries to indicate thier compatablity.
