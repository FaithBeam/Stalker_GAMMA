        <text>Only Type A repair kits are readily available from Mechanic traders, allowing you to easily repair any pistol and most SMGs. \n \nYou need to visit rare stashes to get toolkits that will allow you to buy or craft new repair kits.
         These stashes are depicted by big yellow icons on the map and are rewarded from tasks. \n \nThe more to the north the stash is, the higher the chance to get a better toolkit is. \n \n
         The Toolkits &gt; Repair kit correspondance is the following: \n
            • Basic toolkit &gt; Type B repair kit. \n
            • Advanced toolkit &gt; Type C repair kit. \n
            • Expert toolkit &gt; Type D repair kit.\n \n
