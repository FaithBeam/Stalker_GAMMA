        <text>You just looted your first gun, congratulations. However it might not be readily useable considering the gun's parts condition:\n
		 - Barrel condition affects bullets damage and armor penetration. Meaning: using a gun with a poor condition barrel is worthless. A 9x18 pistol in good condition is better than a rifle in poor condition. This is mainly for balance purposes (otherwise you can get geared in 5 minutes). Focus on looting guns with a green condition barrel.\n
		 - Internal parts condition affect the chance of jamming. \n \n
		 
		Let's learn how to repair guns.

		As you'll progress through the Zone, you will loot gun parts.\n
		You can simply drag and drop parts on a gun to swap parts. The barrel cannot be swapped however.\n \n
		
		Guns with good quality barrels (green) are use much easier and cheaper to repair.

		If a part condition is above or equal to 60%, you need to buy/craft a cleaning kit of the same type as the gun (mind the gun and cleaning kits letters A &gt; A, B &gt; B, C &gt; C, D &gt; D).\n \n
		
		Right click the gun &gt; maintenance &gt; clean part &gt; the part will be at 100% condition.\n \n
		
        Additionally, parts can be repaired from the inventory by doube-clicking a repair kit and selecting the part to repair.\n \n
		
        Cleaning kits can all be bought from any Mechanic trader right from the start.\n \n
		
		That is why guns with a green condition barrel are extremely valuable: they can be easily repaired to deal full damage, from the start, just using a single cleaning kit that you can buy almost anywhere in the Zone.\n \n

		Only Type A repair kits are readily available from Mechanic traders, allowing you to easily repair any pistol and most SMGs. \n \n
		
		You need to visit rare stashes to get toolkits that will allow you to buy or craft new repair kits. These stashes are depicted by big yellow icons on the map and are rewarded from tasks. \n \n
		
		The more to the north the stash is, the higher the chance to get a better toolkit is. \n \n
		
        The Toolkits &gt; Repair kit crafting correspondance is the following: \n
            • Basic toolkit &gt; Type B repair kit. \n
            • Advanced toolkit &gt; Type C repair kit. \n
            • Expert toolkit &gt; Type D repair kit.\n \n
